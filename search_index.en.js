will import the data into Classroom.\nOur main learning/teaching resource will be \"The Book\".\nSchedule\n\n2022-03-01: Introduction. Setting up the environment. Why Rust? \"Hello world\".\n2022-03-08: Ownership and borrow checking. Data types and structures.\n2022-03-15: Enums. Pattern matching. Option and Result. Cargo test.\n2022-03-22: Reasoning about types - generics, traits and lifetimes.\n2022-03-29: Closures and iterators.\n\nGrading\n\n1/3 of the grade is based on small tasks. There will be approximately 1 task every two weeks and each task will be graded on a scale of 0 to 3.\n2/3 of the grade is based on a big project.

Indeed, Rust's ownership model lies at the very core of its uniqueness. But to fully understand it and appreciate it, let's first take a look at how memory management is handled in most popular languages.\n\n\nGarbage Collection - in many high-level programming languages, like Java, Haskell or Python, memory management is done fully by the language, relieving the programmer from this burden. This prevents memory leaks and memory related errors (like use after free), but does come at a cost - there is a runtime overhead, both memory and performance wise, caused by the constantly running garbage collection algorithms and the programmer usually has very little control over when the garbage collection takes place.\n\n\nMind your own memory - in low-level languages and specific ones like C++, performance comes first so we cannot really afford to run expansive bookkeeping and cleaning algorithms. Most of these languages compile directly to machine code and have no language-specific runtime environment. That means that the only place where memory management can happen is in the produced code. While compilers insert these allocation and deallocation calls for stack allocated memory, it generally requires a lot of discipline from the programmer to adhere to good practices and patterns to avoid as many memory related issues as possible and one such bug can be quite deadly to the program and a nightmare to find and fix. These languages basically live by the \"your memory, your problem\" mantra.management of stack allocated memory\n\n\nAnd then we have Rust. Rust is a systems programming language and in many ways it's akin to C++ - it's basically low-level with many high-level additions. But unlike C++, it doesn't exactly fall into either of the categories described above, though it's way closer to the second one. It performs no additional management at runtime, but instead imposes a set of rules on the code, making it easier to reason about and thus check for its safety and correctness at compile time - these rules make up Rust's ownership model.\nIn a way, programming in Rust is like pair-programming with a patient and very experienced partner. Rust's compiler will make sure you follow all the good patterns and practices (by having them ingrained in the language itself) and very often even tell you how to fix the issues it finds.\nDisclaimer: when delving deeper into Rust below we will make heavy use of concepts like scopes, moving data, stack and heap, which should have been introduced as part of the JNP1 C++ course. If you need a refresher of any of these, it's best to do so now, before reading further.\nStart with the basics - ownership\nIn the paragraph above we mentioned a set of rules that comprise Rust's ownership model. The book starts off with the following three as its very foundation:\n\n\nEach value in Rust is tied to a specific variable - we call that variable its owner.\n\n\nThere can only be one owner at a time.\n\n\nWhen the owner goes out of scope, the value will be destroyed (or in Rust terms - dropped).\n\n\nThe third point might make you think about C++ and its automatic storage duration. We will later see that, while very similar at first, Rust expands on these mechanics quite a bit. The following code illustrates the basic version of this:\n{\n    let a: i32 = 5; // allocation on the stack, 'a' becomes an owner\n\n    // do some stuff with 'a'\n\n} // 'a', the owner, goes out of scope and the value is dropped\n\nSo far, so good. Variables are pushed onto the stack when they enter the scope and destroyed during stack unwinding that happens upon leaving their scope. However, allocating and deallocating simple integers doesn't impress anybody. Let's try something more complex:\n{\n    let s = String::from(\"a string\"); // 's' is allocated on the stack, while its contents (\"a string\")\n                                      // are allocated on the heap. 's' is the owner of this String object.\n\n    // do some stuff with 'a'\n\n} // 's', the owner, goes out of scope and the String is dropped, its heap allocated memory freed\n\nIf you recall the RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) pattern from C++, the above is basically the same thing. We go two for two now in the similarity department, so... is Rust really any different then? There is a part of these examples that we skipped over - actually doing something with the values.\nMoving around is fun\nLet's expand on the last example. The scoping is not really important for that one, so we don't include it here.\nlet s = String::from(\"a string\"); // same thing, 's' is now an owner\n\nlet s2 = s; // easy, 's2' becomes another owner... right?\n\nprintln!(\"And the contents are: {}\", s); // this doesn't work, can you guess why?\n\nAt first glance everything looks great. If we write this code (well, an equivalent of it) in basically any other popular language, it will compile no issue - but it does not here and there's a good reason why.\nTo understand what's happening, we have to consult the rules again, rule 2 in particular. It says that there can only be one owner of any value at a given time. So, s and s2 cannot own the same object. Okay, makes sense, but what is happening in this line then - let s2 = s;? Experience probably tells you that s just gets copied into s2, creating a new String object. That would result in each variable owning its very own instance of the string and each instance having exactly one owner. Sounds like everyone should be happy now, but wait - in that case the last line should work no issue, right? But it doesn't, so can't be a copy. Let's see now what the compiler actually has to say:\nerror[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:6:42\n  |\n2 |     let s = String::from(\"a string\");\n  |         - move occurs because `s` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n3 |\n4 |     let s2 = s;\n  |              - value moved here\n5 |\n6 |     println!(\"And the contents are: {}\", s);\n  |                                          ^ value borrowed here after move\n\n\"value moved here\" - gotcha! So s is being moved to s2, which also means that s2 now becomes the new owner of the string being moved and s is left in an invalid state. In Rust, the default method of passing values around is by move, not by copy. While it may sound a bit odd at first, it actually has some very interesting implications. But before we get to them, let's fix our code so it compiles now. To do so, we have to explicitly tell Rust to make a copy by invoking the clone method:\nlet s = String::from(\"a string\"); // 's' is an owner\n\nlet s2 = s.clone(); // 's2' now contains its own copy\n\nprintln!(\"And the contents are: {}\", s); // success!\n\nThe compiler is happy now and so are we. The implicit move takes some getting used to, but the compiler is here to help us. Now, let's put the good, old C++ on the table again and compare the two lines:\n\nlet s2 = s; is equivalent to auto s2 = std::move(s);\nlet s2 = s.clone() is equivalent to auto s2 = s\n\nThere are a few important things to note here:\n\n\nMaking a copy is oftentimes not cheap. Memory needs to be allocated and copied, and a call to the system has to be made. We should prefer to move things as much as possible to avoid this cost - in C++ we have a myriad of language features like std::move and r-references to achieve this. Every programmer worth their salt needs to be well versed in all of them to write efficient C++ code and simply forgetting one move can lead to significant performance loss (and this happens to even the most senior devs ever existing, let's not pretend). On the contrary, in Rust you need to make an effort to make a copy and that makes you very aware of the cost you're paying - something that we'll see quite a lot of in the language. Also, if you forget a clone there's no harm done - it just won't compile!\n\n\nHidden in all of this is another nice thing Rust gives us. In C++, nothing prevents you from using variables after they've been moved from, leading to unexpected errors in a more complex code. In Rust, that variable (in our case s) simply becomes invalid and the compiler gives us a nice error about it.\n\n\nBut what about ints?\nA good question to ask. Copying primitives is cheap. And it's not convenient for the programmer to have to always write .clone() after every primitive. If we take a look at the error from the previous example:\nmove occurs because `s` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait`\n\nIt says that s was moved because the String type doesn't have the Copy trait. We will talk about traits more in depth in the future lessons, but what this basically means is that String is not specified to be copied by default. All primitive types (i32, bool, f64, char, etc.) and tuples consisting only of primitive types implement the Copy trait.\nExercise\nHow to fix that code?\nfn count_animals(num: u32, animal: String) {\n    println!(\"{} {} ...\", num, animal);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let s = String::from(\"sheep\");\n\n  count_animals(1, s);\n  count_animals(2, s);\n  count_animals(3, s);\n}\n\nLet's borrow some books\nWe now know how to move things around and how to clone them if moving is not possible. But what if making a copy is unnecessary - maybe we just want to let someone look at our resource and keep on holding onto it once their done. Consider the following example:\nfn read_book(book: String) {\n    println!(\"[Reading] {}\", book);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let book = String::from(\"Merry lived in a big old house. The end.\");\n\n  read_book(book.clone());\n\n  println!(\"Book is still there: {}\", book);\n}\n\nCloning is pretty excessive here. Imagine recommending a book to your friend and instead of lending it to them for the weekend, you scan it and print an exact copy. Not the best way to go about it, is it? Thankfully, Rust allows us to access a resource without becoming an owner through the use of references and the &amp; operator. This is called a borrow.\nThe adjusted code should look like this:\nfn read_book(book: &amp;String) {\n    println!(\"[Reading] {}\", book);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let book = String::from(\"Merry lived in a big old house. The end.\");\n\n  read_book(&amp;book);\n\n  println!(\"Book is still there: {}\", book);\n}\n\nAs with everything, references are too, by default, immutable, which means that the read_book function is not able to modify that book passed into it. We can also borrow something mutably by specifing it both in the receiving function signature and the place it gets called. Maybe you want to have your book signed by its author?\nfn sign_book(book: &amp;mut String) {\n    book.push_str(\" ~ Arthur Author\");\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  // note that the book has to be marked as mutable in the first place\n  let mut book = String::from(\"Merry lived in a big old house. The end.\");\n\n  sign_book(&amp;mut book); // it's always clear when a parameter might get modified\n\n  println!(\"{}\", book); // book is now signed\n}\n\nPretty neat, but doesn't seem that safe right now. Let's try to surprise our friend:\nfn erase_book(book: &amp;mut String) {\n    book.clear();\n}\n\nfn read_book(book: &amp;String) {\n    println!(\"[Reading] {}\", book);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let mut book = String::from(\"Merry lived in a big old house. The end.\");\n\n  let r = &amp;book; // an immutable borrow\n\n  erase_book(&amp;mut book); // a mutable borrow\n\n  read_book(r); // would be pretty sad to open a blank book when it was not\n                // what we borrowed initially\n\n  println!(\"{}\", book);\n}\n\nFortunately for us (and our poor friend just wanting to read), the compiler steps in and doesn't let us do that, printing the following message:\nerror[E0502]: cannot borrow `book` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable\n  --&gt; src/main.rs:14:14\n   |\n12 |   let r = &amp;book; // an immutable borrow\n   |           ----- immutable borrow occurs here\n13 |\n14 |   erase_book(&amp;mut book); // a mutable borrow\n   |              ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here\n15 |\n16 |   read_book(r); // would be pretty sad to open a blank book when it was not\n   |             - immutable borrow later used here\n\nThis is where the famous borrow checker comes in. To keep things super safe, Rust clearly states what can and cannot be done with references and tracks their lifetimes. Exactly one of the following is always true for references to a given resource:\n\n\nThere exists only one mutable reference and no immutable references, or\n\n\nThere is any number of immutable references and no mutable ones.\n\n\nYou may notice a parallel to the readers - writers problem from concurrent programming. In fact, the way Rust's borrow checker is designed lends itself incredibly well to preventing data race related issues.\nDangling references\nRust also checks for dangling references. If we try to compile the following code:\nfn main() {\n    let reference_to_nothing = dangle();\n}\n\nfn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String {\n    let s = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n    &amp;s\n}\n\nwe will get an adequate error:\nerror[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier\n --&gt; src/main.rs:5:16\n  |\n5 | fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;String {\n  |                ^ expected named lifetime parameter\n  |\n  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value for it to be borrowed from\nhelp: consider using the `'static` lifetime\n  |\n5 | fn dangle() -&gt; &amp;'static String {\n  |                ^^^^^^^^\n\nThe message above suggests specifing a lifetime for the returned string. In Rust, the lifetime of each variable is also a part of its type, but we will talk more about it later.\nExercise\nOur previous solution using clone() was pretty inefficient. How should this code look now?\nfn count_animals(num: u32, animal: String) {\n    println!(\"{} {} ...\", num, animal);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let s = String::from(\"sheep\");\n\n  count_animals(1, s.clone());\n  count_animals(2, s.clone());\n  count_animals(3, s); // we could've ommitted the clone() here. Why?\n}\n\nEveryone gets a slice\nThe last part of working with references that we will cover in this lesson are slices. A slice in Rust is a view over continuous data. Let us start with a string slice - the &amp;str type.\nNote: for the purposes of these examples we assume we are working with ASCII strings. More comprehensive articles on handling strings are linked at the end of this lesson.\nTo create a string slice from the String object s, we can simply write:\nlet slice = &amp;s[1..3]; // creates a slice of length 2, starting with the character at index 1\n\nThis makes use of the &amp; operator and Rust's range notation to specify the beginning and end of the slice. Thus, we can also write:\nlet slice = &amp;s[2..];    // everything from index 2 till the end\nlet slice = &amp;s[..1];    // only the first byte\nlet slice = &amp;s[..];     // the whole string as a slice\nlet slice = s.as_str(); // also the whole string\n\nYou might have noticed that we always built String values using the from() method and never actually used the string literals directly. What type is a string literal then? Turns out it's the new string slice we just learned about!\nlet slice: &amp;str = \"string literal\";\n\nIn fact, it makes a lot sense - string literals, after all, are not allocated on the heap, but rather placed in a special section of the resulting binary. It's only natural we just reference that place with a slice.\nSlices can also be taken from arrays:\nlet array: [i32; 4] = [42, 10, 5, 2]; // creates an array of four 32 bit integers\nlet slice: &amp;[i32] = &amp;array[1..3];     // results in a slice [10, 5]\n\nExercise\nCan this code still be improved from the previous version utilizing references? Think about the signature of count_animals.\nfn count_animals(num: u32, animal: &amp;String) {\n    println!(\"{} {} ...\", num, animal);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n  let s = String::from(\"sheep\");\n\n  count_animals(1, &amp;s);\n  count_animals(2, &amp;s);\n  count_animals(3, &amp;s);\n}\n\nFurther reading\n\n\nChar documentation\n\n\nWorking with strings in Rust\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 4\n\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/02-ownership/","title":"Ownership Model"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/03-data-types/":{"body":"Aggregating data\nBelow is a compact overview of Rust's structs\n#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]\nstruct Position(i32, i32); // tuple struct\n\n// Could Hero derive the Copy trait?\n#[derive(Clone, Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]\nstruct Hero {\n    name: String,\n    level: u32,\n    experience: u32,\n    position: Position,\n}\n\n// we can add methods to structs using the 'impl' keyword\nimpl Hero {\n    // static method\n    fn new(name: String) -&gt; Hero {\n        Hero {\n            name,\n            level: 1,\n            experience: 0,\n            position: Position(0, 0),\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// multiple impl blocks are possible for one struct\nimpl Hero {\n    // instance method, first argument (self) is the calling instance\n    fn distance(&amp;self, pos: Position) -&gt; u32 {\n        // fields of tuples and tuple structs can be accessed through 'tuple.[i]'\n        (pos.0 - self.position.0).unsigned_abs() + (pos.1 - self.position.1).unsigned_abs()\n    }\n\n    // mutable borrow of self allows to change instance fields\n    fn level_up(&amp;mut self) {\n        self.experience = 0;\n        self.level += 1;\n    }\n\n    // 'self' is not borrowed here and will be moved into the method\n    fn die(self) {\n        println!(\n            \"Here lies {}, a hero who reached level {}.

Legacy enums are also somewhat safer than in C (same code as above):\n&lt;source&gt;:27:31: error: invalid conversion from 'int' to 'shirt_size' [-fpermissive]\n   27 |     enum shirt_size my_size = 666;\n      |                               ^~~\n      |                               |\n      |                               int\n\nSome programming languages (especially functional ones) allow programmers to define\nenums which carry additional information. Such types are usually called tagged unions\nor algebraic data types.\nIn C++ we can use union with an enum tag to define it:\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\n// Taken from: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/union\n\n// S has one non-static data member (tag), three enumerator members (CHAR, INT, DOUBLE),\n// and three variant members (c, i, d)\nstruct S\n{\n    enum{CHAR, INT, DOUBLE} tag;\n    union\n    {\n        char c;\n        int i;\n        double d;\n    };\n};\n\nvoid print_s(const S&amp;

They can be compared to interfaces from many other mainstream languages or to typeclasses from Haskell, however, Rust is not an object-oriented language and there are some notable differences between type traits and typeclasses.\nThe way we describe behavior in Rust is through methods. Traits consist of a set of these methods which then should be implemented by a type. We've already encountered examples of these, like the Clone trait which specified that the clone() method can be called on some given type. Now, let's take a deeper look and try defining our own trait.\n#![allow(dead_code)]\n\ntrait Summary {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String;\n}\n\nstruct NewsArticle {\n    headline: String,\n    location: String,\n    author: String,\n    content: String,\n}\n\nimpl Summary for NewsArticle {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{}, by {} ({})\", self.headline, self.author, self.location)\n    }\n}\n\nstruct Tweet {\n    username: String,\n    content: String,\n}\n\nimpl Summary for Tweet {\n    fn summarize(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{}: {}\", self.username, self.content)\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let tweet = Tweet {\n        username: String::from(\"horse_ebooks\"),\n        content: String::from(\"of course, as you probably already know, people\"),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"1 new tweet: {}\", tweet.summarize());\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: basic_trait.rs)\nDefault implementations\nTrait definitions can also be provided with default implementations of behaviors.\n#![allow(dead_code)]\n\nstruct Upload {\n    filename: String,\n}\n\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nstruct Photo {\n    filename: String,\n    width: u32,\n    height: u32,\n}\n\ntrait Description {\n    fn describe(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        String::from(\"No description available.\")\n    }\n}\n\n// All default implementations\nimpl Description for Upload {}\n\n// Default implementations can be overwritten\nimpl Description for Photo {\n    fn describe(&amp;self) -&gt; String {\n        format!(\"{} ({} x {})\", self.filename, self.width, self.height)\n    }\n}\n\n// Default implementations can rely on methods with no defaults\ntrait Size {\n    fn width(&amp;self) -&gt; u32;\n    fn height(&amp;self) -&gt; u32;\n\n    fn size(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {\n        self.width() * self.height()\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Size for Photo {\n    fn width(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {\n        self.width\n    }\n\n    fn height(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {\n        self.height\n    }\n\n    // Using default impl of `size()`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let upload = Upload {\n        filename: String::from(\"notes.txt\"),\n    };\n\n    println!(\"Upload: {}\", upload.describe());\n\n    let photo = Photo {\n        filename: String::from(\"stock_crustacean.png\"),\n        width: 100,\n        height: 150,\n    };\n\n    println!(\"Photo: {}\", photo.describe());\n    println!(\"Size: {}\", photo.size());\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: trait_default.rs)\nWhat about derive?\nThere is a trait-related thing we have used quite extensively and not explained yet, namely the #[derive] attribute. What it does is generate items (in our case a trait implementation) based on the given data definition (here a struct). Below you can find a list of derivable traits from the standard library. Writing derivation rules for user defined traits is also possible, but goes out of the scope of this lesson.\nDerivable traits:\n\n\nEquality traits: Eq, PartialEq and comparison traits: Ord and PartialOrd. The Partial- versions exist because there are types which don't fulfill the reflexivity requirement of equality (NaN != NaN) or do not form a total order ( NaN &lt; 0.0 == false and NaN &gt;= 0.0 == false).\n\n\nData duplication traits: Clone and Copy\n\n\nHash - allows using values of that type as keys in a hashmap\n\n\nDefault - provides a zero-arg constructor function\n\n\nDebug - provides a formatting of the value which can be used in debugging context. It should NOT be implemented manually. In general, if it's possible to derive the Debug, there are no reasons against doing it.\n\n\nWhen is it possible to derive a trait?\nWhen all fields of a struct/variants of an enum implement that trait.\nShould all traits always be derived if it is possible?\nNo. Although it may be tempting to just slap #[derive(Clone, Copy)] everywhere, it would be counter-effective. For example, at some later point you might add a non-Copy field to the struct and your (or, what's worse, someone else's!) code would break. Another example: it makes little sense to use containers as keys in hashmaps or to compare tweets.\nGenerics\nSuppose we want to find the largest element in a sequence and return it. Very much on purpose, we didn't specify what type these elements would be - ideally, we would love it to work on all types that have a defined notion of a largest element. However, to make things simpler for now, let's focus only on two primitive types: i32 and char. Let's try to write the code:\nfn largest_i32(list: &amp;[i32]) -&gt; i32 {\n    let mut largest = list[0];\n\n    for &amp;item in list {\n        if item &gt; largest {\n            largest = item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    largest\n}\n\nfn largest_char(list: &amp;[char]) -&gt; char {\n    let mut largest = list[0];\n\n    for &amp;item in list {\n        if item &gt; largest {\n            largest = item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    largest\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];\n\n    let result = largest_i32(&amp;number_list);\n    println!(\"The largest number is {}\", result);\n\n    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];\n\n    let result = largest_char(&amp;char_list);\n    println!(\"The largest char is {}\", result);\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: non_generic.rs)\nPerfect, it works! Now only twenty more types to go...\nFortunately, Rust gives us a way to avoid all this code duplication and generalize the types we're working on.\nfn largest&lt;T&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {\n    let mut largest = list[0];\n\n    for &amp;item in list {\n        if item &gt; largest {\n            largest = item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    largest\n}\n\nCleaner already - we merged possibly very many implementations into one. But, when we try to compile this:\nerror[E0369]: binary operation `&gt;` cannot be applied to type `T`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:5:17\n  |\n5 |         if item &gt; largest {\n  |            ---- ^ ------- T\n  |            |\n  |            T\n  |\nhelp: consider restricting type parameter `T`\n  |\n1 | fn largest&lt;T: std::cmp::PartialOrd&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {\n  |             ++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nSince T can be of absolutely any type now, the compiler cannot be sure that operator &gt; is defined. This aligns with what we wanted, as without comparing elements we don't have a notion of the largest one either. As always, the compiler comes to our aid:\nfn largest&lt;T: PartialOrd&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {\n    let mut largest = list[0];\n\n    for &amp;item in list {\n        if item &gt; largest {\n            largest = item;\n        }\n    }\n\n    largest\n}\n\nWe call this a trait bound, a way to provide constraints on what kind of types we are talking about in a given context. This implementation almost works now. Let's look at the new error.\nerror[E0508]: cannot move out of type `[T]`, a non-copy slice\n --&gt; src/main.rs:2:23\n  |\n2 |     let mut largest = list[0];\n  |                       ^^^^^^^\n  |                       |\n  |                       cannot move out of here\n  |                       move occurs because `list[_]` has type `T`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n  |                       help: consider borrowing here: `&amp;list[0]`\n\nerror[E0507]: cannot move out of a shared reference\n --&gt; src/main.rs:4:18\n  |\n4 |     for &amp;item in list {\n  |         -----    ^^^^\n  |         ||\n  |         |data moved here\n  |         |move occurs because `item` has type `T`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n  |         help: consider removing the `&amp;`: `item`\n\nOur function attempts to take ownership, but, again, the compiler doesn't know whether T can just be trivially copied. Rust allows us to combine multiple trait bounds together:\nfn largest&lt;T: PartialOrd + Copy&gt;(list: &amp;[T]) -&gt; T {\n    let mut largest = list[0];\n\n    for &amp;item in list {\n        if item &gt;

But what exactly is happening behind the scenes? Rust introduces a concept of annotated lifetimes, where the lifetime of each value is being marked and tracked by the checker. Let's look at some examples:\n{\n    let r;                  // ---------+-- 'a\n                            //          |\n    {                       //          |\n        let x = 5;          // -+-- 'b  |\n        r = &amp;x;             //  |       |\n    }                       // -+       |\n                            //          |\n    println!(\"r: {}\", r);   //          |\n}                           // ---------+\n\n{\n    let x = 5;              // ----------+-- 'b\n                            //           |\n    let r = &amp;x;             // --+-- 'a  |\n                            //   |       |\n    println!(\"r: {}\", r);   //   |       |\n                            // --+       |\n}                           // ----------+\n\nAnnotations\nLet's consider the following code finding the longer out of two strings:\nfn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {\n    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {\n        x\n    } else {\n        y\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let string1 = String::from(\"abcd\");\n    let string2 = \"xyz\";\n\n    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);\n    println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\n}\n\nIf we try to compile this, we will get an error:\nerror[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier\n --&gt; src/main.rs:9:33\n  |\n9 | fn longest(x: &amp;str, y: &amp;str) -&gt; &amp;str {\n  |               ----     ----     ^ expected named lifetime parameter\n  |\n  = help: this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but the signature does not say whether it is borrowed from `x` or `y`\nhelp: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter\n  |\n9 | fn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n  |           ++++     ++          ++          ++\n\nThis is because Rust doesn't know which of the two provided strings (x or y) will be returned from the function. And because they potentially have different lifetimes, the lifetime of what we are returning remains unclear to the compiler - it needs our help.\nRust provides syntax for specifying lifetimes. The lifetime parameter name from the example (a) doesn't have any concrete meaning - it's just an arbitrary name for this one lifetime.\n&amp;i32        // a reference\n&amp;'a i32     // a reference with an explicit lifetime\n&amp;'a mut i32 // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime\n\nSo, knowing this, let's address the compiler's demands.\nfn longest&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a str, y: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {\n        x\n    } else {\n        y\n    }\n}\n\nWhen working with lifetimes, our work will usually revolve around specifying relationships between lifetimes of different values so that the compiler can successfully reason about the program's safety. In the context of the example above, this signature means that both of the function's arguments and its output will live at least as long as lifetime 'a. In practice, this means that the output's lifetime will be equal to the smaller of the two inputs' lifetimes.\nfn longest&lt;'a&gt;(first: &amp;'a str, second: &amp;'a str) -&gt; &amp;'a str {\n    if first.len() &gt; second.len() {\n        first\n    } else {\n        second\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let string1 = String::from(\"long string is long\");\n\n    {\n        let string2 = String::from(\"xyz\");\n        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());\n        println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\n    }\n\n    // This doesn't compile - incorrect lifetimes\n    //\n    // let string1 = String::from(\"long string is long\");\n    // let result;\n    // {\n    //     let string2 = String::from(\"xyz\");\n    //     result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());\n    // }\n    // println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: lifetimes_basic.rs)\nTrying to compile the second variant displeases the compiler (just like we hoped).\nerror[E0597]: `string2` does not live long enough\n --&gt; src/main.rs:6:44\n  |\n6 |         result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());\n  |                                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ borrowed value does not live long enough\n7 |     }\n  |     - `string2` dropped here while still borrowed\n8 |     println!(\"The longest string is {}\", result);\n  |                                          ------ borrow later used here\n\nLifetime elision\nWe now know how to explicitly write lifetime parameters, but you might recall that we don't always have to that. Indeed, Rust will first try to figure out the lifetimes itself, applying a set of predefined rules. We call this lifetime elision.\nfn first_two(seq: &amp;[u32]) -&gt; &amp;[u32] {\n    if seq.len() &lt; 2 {\n        seq\n    } else {\n        &amp;seq[..2]\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let seq = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n\n    println!(\n        \"First two elements of the sequence: {:?}\",\n        first_two(&amp;seq[..])\n    );\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: lifetimes_elision.rs)\nThe above works, even though we didn't specify any lifetime parameters at all. The reason lies in the rules we mentioned, which are as follows (where input lifetimes are lifetimes on parameters and output lifetimes are lifetimes on return values):\n\n\nEach parameter that is a reference gets its own lifetime parameter.\n\n\nIf there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.\n\n\nIf there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &amp;self or &amp;mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters.\n\n\nLet's try to understand how the compiler inferred the lifetimes of our first_two functions. We start with the following signature:\nfn first_two(seq: &amp;[u32]) -&gt; &amp;[u32] {\n\nThen, we apply the first rule:\nfn first_two&lt;'a&gt;(seq: &amp;'a [u32]) -&gt; &amp;[u32] {\n\nNext, we check the second rule. It applies here as well.\nfn first_two&lt;'a&gt;(seq: &amp;'a [u32]) -&gt; &amp;'a [u32] {\n\nWith that, we arrive at a state where all lifetimes are specified.\nStatic lifetime\nThere exists one special lifetime called 'static, which means that a reference can live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals are annotated with this lifetime as they are stored directly in the program's binary. Full type annotation of a string literal in Rust is therefore as follows:\nlet s: &amp;'static str = \"I have a static lifetime.\";\n\nObligatory reading\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 10\n\n\nPolymorphism in Rust\n\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/06-types-reasoning/","title":"Reasoning About Types"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/07-feedback/":{"body":"Constructors\nThere are no \"constructors\" in Rust.\nThere is exactly one way to create an instance of a user-defined type: name\nit and initialize all its fields at once.\nHowever, we often write associated functions that act as constructors.\nIn the below example you may notice a new keyword - pub.

We didn't really have to be aware of the fact that these collections used the heap, as all that memory management details were hidden away from us. In this lesson we'll take a closer look at what is really happening there and how we can do that ourselves.\nTo work with heap-allocated memory, Rust features smart pointers. You should have already heard this term as it is a very important feature in C++ and the concept is virtually the same here - they are wrappers around raw allocated memory that provide additional, safety-ensuring mechanism. What defines a smart pointer in Rust is generally the implementation of two traits: Drop and Deref.\nThe Drop trait is pretty straightforward as it consists of one method - fn drop(&amp;mut self) - that is, basically, the destructor, invoked during stack unwinding.\nThe Deref trait allows us to overload the dereference (*) operator.\nDeref coercion\nApart from enabling access to the underlying value, implementing the Deref trait enables Rust to perform deref coercion on the pointer - trying to remove as many levels of indirection as it can. What it means in practice is that we will be able to use it with any code working on plain references.\nuse std::ops::Deref;\n\nstruct MyBox&lt;T&gt;(T);\n\n// We won't be allocating anything on the heap here as it is not important here.\n// We're only focusing on the dereference mechanisms.\nimpl&lt;T&gt; MyBox&lt;T&gt; {\n    fn new(x: T) -&gt; MyBox&lt;T&gt; {\n        MyBox(x)\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Deref for MyBox&lt;T&gt; {\n    type Target = T;\n\n    fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target {\n        &amp;self.0\n    }\n}\n\nfn hello(name: &amp;str) {\n    println!(\"Hello, {}!\", name);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let x = 5;\n    let int_box = MyBox::new(x);\n\n    assert_eq!(5, *int_box);\n\n    // String also implements the `Deref` trait.\n    // In fact, String actually is a smart pointer.\n    let s = String::from(\"I'm a smart pointer too\");\n    hello(&amp;s);\n\n    // Deref coercion can deal with multiple levels of indirection.\n    let str_box = MyBox::new(String::from(\"Rust\"));\n    hello(&amp;str_box);\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: deref_coercion.rs)\nIn general, there are three possible coercions that Rust can perform:\n\n\nFrom &amp;T to &amp;U when T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nFrom &amp;mut T to &amp;mut U when T: DerefMut&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nFrom &amp;mut T to &amp;U when T: Deref&lt;Target=U&gt;\n\n\nWhile the first two coercions are straightforward, the third one is possible because treating a mutable reference as an immutable one does not break the rules of ownership.\nBox - simple wrapper\nThe Box&lt;T&gt; type is the most basic out of Rust's smart pointers, equivalent to C++'s std::unique_ptr&lt;T&gt;. It's a simple wrapper that makes sure the underlying memory gets allocated and freed properly.\nfn box_simple() {\n    let b = Box::new(5);\n    println!(\"b = {}\", b);\n\n    let _x = 10 + *b;\n}\n\n// `Box` gives us the indirection required to define\n// recursive types\n#[allow(dead_code)]\nenum List {\n    Cons(i32, Box&lt;List&gt;),\n    Nil,\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    box_simple();\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: box.rs)\nReference counting\nThe Rc&lt;T&gt; type is the equivalent of std::shared_ptr&lt;T&gt; from C++. There is one caveat to this though - because we're creating multiple references to the same object, those references have to be immutable in accordance with the ownership rules.\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct LoudInt(i32);\n\nimpl Drop for LoudInt {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        println!(\"[{}] Farewell!\", self.0);\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    {\n        let outer_ref;\n\n        {\n            let inner_ref = Rc::new(LoudInt(5));\n\n            // strong_count represents the number of owning references pointing\n            // to data\n            assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;inner_ref), 1);\n\n            outer_ref = Rc::clone(&amp;inner_ref);\n\n            assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;inner_ref), Rc::strong_count(&amp;outer_ref));\n            assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;inner_ref), 2);\n        }\n\n        println!(\"The {} still lives!\", outer_ref.0);\n        assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;outer_ref), 1);\n    }\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: ref_count.rs)\nRust also provides a non-owning pointer in the form of Weak&lt;T&gt; (equivalent to std::weak_ptr&lt;T&gt;) that can be obtained from an instance of Rc&lt;T&gt;.\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct LoudInt(i32);\n\nimpl Drop for LoudInt {\n    fn drop(&amp;mut self) {\n        println!(\"[{}] Farewell!\", self.0);\n    }\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let weak_ref;\n\n    {\n        let shared_ref = Rc::new(LoudInt(5));\n\n        // weak_count keeps track of the non-owning reference to the data\n        assert_eq!(Rc::weak_count(&amp;shared_ref), 0);\n\n        // `downgrade()` obtains a weak pointer to Rc's data\n        weak_ref = Rc::downgrade(&amp;shared_ref);\n\n        assert_eq!(Rc::weak_count(&amp;shared_ref), 1);\n        assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;shared_ref), 1);\n\n        // In order to use the the data underneath the weak pointer\n        // we need to obtain a new shared pointer from it.\n        // The `upgrade()` method returns `Option&lt;Rc&lt;T&gt;&gt;`.\n        let temp = weak_ref.upgrade();\n        assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&amp;shared_ref), 2);\n        println!(\"The value is {}\", temp.unwrap().0);\n    }\n\n    println!(\"The value should be deallocated by now.\");\n    matches!(weak_ref.upgrade(), None);\n}\n\n\n(Download the source code for this example: weak_ref.rs)\nMutating the immutable\nGood examples and explanation of the inferior mutability pattern and runtime borrow checking can be found in the book.\nAlongisde the RefCell&lt;T&gt; type described above, there is an analogous Cell&lt;T&gt; type that operates on values instead of references.\nObligatory reading\n\n\nThe Book, chapter 15\n\n\nstd::borrow::Cow, a versatile copy-on-write smart pointer\n\n\nAdditional reading\n\nOn wrapped references\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/10-smart-pointers/","title":"Smart Pointers"},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/11-feedback3/":{"body":"Iterators\nToo many bools\nMany people implemented the InterleaveIterator like this:\npub struct InterleaveIterator&lt;I: Iterator, J: Iterator&gt; {\n    iter1: I,\n    iter2: J,\n    not_finished1: bool,\n    not_finished2: bool,\n    turn_of_first: bool,\n}\n\nThere's no need to use bools to keep track of whether the iterators are finished.

See the nomicon for more information.\nAtomic types\nAtomic types are described in the docs.\nuse std::sync::Arc;\nuse std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};\nuse std::{hint, thread};\n\nfn main() {\n    let spinlock = Arc::new(AtomicUsize::new(1));\n\n    let spinlock_clone = Arc::clone(&amp;spinlock);\n    let thread = thread::spawn(move|| {\n        spinlock_clone.store(0, Ordering::SeqCst);\n    });\n\n    // Wait for the other thread to release the lock\n    while spinlock.load(Ordering::SeqCst) != 0 {\n        hint::spin_loop();\n    }\n\n    if let Err(panic) = thread.join() {\n        println!(\"Thread had an error: {:?}\", panic);\n    }\n}\n\nNote that atomic values don't have to be wrapped in a mutex when shared across threads.\nWait...\nIf most types are Sync + Send, then what stops us from using a standard, non-atomic integer in the example above?\nlet spinlock = Arc::new(1);\n\nlet spinlock_clone = Arc::clone(&amp;spinlock);\nlet thread = thread::spawn(move|| {\n    *spinlock_clone += 1;\n});\n\nwhile *spinlock != 0 {\n    hint::spin_loop();\n}\n\nerror[E0594]: cannot assign to data in an `Arc`\n --&gt; src/main.rs:9:9\n  |\n9 |         *spinlock_clone += 1;\n  |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot assign\n  |\n  = help: trait `DerefMut` is required to modify through a dereference, but it is not implemented for `Arc&lt;i32&gt;`\n\n...so we would have to use a RefCell to be able to modify the value through a shared reference...\nlet spinlock = Arc::new(RefCell::new(1));\n\nlet spinlock_clone = Arc::clone(&amp;spinlock);\nlet thread = thread::spawn(move|| {\n    *spinlock_clone.borrow_mut() += 1;\n});\n\n// Wait for the other thread to release the lock\nwhile *spinlock.borrow() != 0 {\n    hint::spin_loop();\n}\n\n...but RefCell isn't Sync:\nerror[E0277]: `RefCell&lt;i32&gt;` cannot be shared between threads safely\n   --&gt; src/main.rs:9:18\n    |\n9   |     let thread = thread::spawn(move|| {\n    |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `RefCell&lt;i32&gt;` cannot be shared between threads safely\n    |\n    = help: the trait `Sync` is not implemented for `RefCell&lt;i32&gt;`\n    = note: required because of the requirements on the impl of `Send` for `Arc&lt;RefCell&lt;i32&gt;&gt;`\n    = note: required because it appears within the type `[closure@src/main.rs:9:32: 11:6]`\nnote: required by a bound in `spawn`\n\nAnd that bound mentioned in the last line looks like this:\npub fn spawn&lt;F, T&gt;(f: F) -&gt; JoinHandle&lt;T&gt; where\n    F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,\n    F: Send + 'static,\n    T: Send + 'static,\n\nExercise for the reader\nWhy is it impossible to share a reference to a Mutex between threads?\nData parallelism with Rayon\nRayon is a library for parallelization of data processing.\nIt can be used to parallelize the execution of functions over a collection of data by switching the standard Iterator to a ParallelIterator.\nIt works very similar to Java's parallel streams.\nWhy do that? Because thread synchronization is hard! Rust prevents data races, but logical races and deadlocks are impossible to prevent!!\nRayon's FAQ is worth reading.\nAssignment #5 (graded)\nHere you can find the fifth graded assignment.

With this basic understanding of what we expect out of futures, let's try to come up with their details ourselves.\nWe know that, when asked, a future can either give us a ready value or still be waiting for it. Asking about the future's result is called polling. Our future could look something like this:\ntrait SimpleFuture {\n    type Output;\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;\n}\n\nenum Poll&lt;T&gt; {\n    Ready(T),\n    Pending,\n}\n\nThe poll method can be called to check for the result of the future. There is a flaw in this however - whatever is coordinating our future-based computations will have to constantly poll each of them in hope they are ready to do some work.\ntrait SimpleFuture {\n    type Output;\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self, wake: fn()) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;\n}\n\n\nWe can solve this by attaching a callback to our polling. The wake function passed to poll can be used to notify whoever issued the poll that the future is ready to make some progress and should be polled.\nLet's picture a quick example of how our SimpleFuture could be used.\npub struct SocketRead&lt;'a&gt; {\n    socket: &amp;'a Socket,\n}\n\nimpl SimpleFuture for SocketRead&lt;'_&gt; {\n    type Output = Vec&lt;u8&gt;;\n\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self, wake: fn()) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {\n        if self.socket.has_data_to_read() {\n            // The socket has data -- read it into a buffer and return it.\n            Poll::Ready(self.socket.read_buf())\n        } else {\n            // The socket does not yet have data.\n            //\n            // Arrange for `wake` to be called once data is available.\n            // When data becomes available, `wake` will be called, and the\n            // user of this `Future` will know to call `poll` again and\n            // receive data.\n            self.socket.set_readable_callback(wake);\n            Poll::Pending\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nCombining futures\nWith the SimpleFuture at our disposal we can easily model more advanced concurrent computations.\n/// Concurrency is achieved via the fact that calls to `poll` each future\n/// may be interleaved, allowing each future to advance itself at its own pace.\npub struct Join&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt; {\n    // Each field may contain a future that should be run to completion.\n    // If the future has already completed, the field is set to `None`.\n    // This prevents us from polling a future after it has completed, which\n    // would violate the contract of the `Future` trait.\n    a: Option&lt;FutureA&gt;,\n    b: Option&lt;FutureB&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt; SimpleFuture for Join&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt;\nwhere\n    FutureA: SimpleFuture&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n    FutureB: SimpleFuture&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n{\n    type Output = ();\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self, wake: fn()) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {\n        // Attempt to complete future `a`.\n        if let Some(a) = &amp;mut self.a {\n            if let Poll::Ready(()) = a.poll(wake) {\n                self.a.take();\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Attempt to complete future `b`.\n        if let Some(b) = &amp;mut self.b {\n            if let Poll::Ready(()) = b.poll(wake) {\n                self.b.take();\n            }\n        }\n\n        if self.a.is_none() &amp;&amp; self.b.is_none() {\n            // Both futures have completed -- we can return successfully\n            Poll::Ready(())\n        } else {\n            // One or both futures returned `Poll::Pending` and still have\n            // work to do. They will call `wake()` when progress can be made.\n            Poll::Pending\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nWe can also queue futures like this:\npub struct AndThenFut&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt; {\n    first: Option&lt;FutureA&gt;,\n    second: FutureB,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt; SimpleFuture for AndThenFut&lt;FutureA, FutureB&gt;\nwhere\n    FutureA: SimpleFuture&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n    FutureB: SimpleFuture&lt;Output = ()&gt;,\n{\n    type Output = ();\n    fn poll(&amp;mut self, wake: fn()) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt; {\n        if let Some(first) = &amp;mut self.first {\n            match first.poll(wake) {\n                // We've completed the first future -- remove it and start on\n                // the second!\n                Poll::Ready(()) =&gt; self.first.take(),\n                // We couldn't yet complete the first future.\n                Poll::Pending =&gt; return Poll::Pending,\n            };\n        }\n        // Now that the first future is done, attempt to complete the second.\n        self.second.poll(wake)\n    }\n}\n\nExercise\nThe last example assumes that both futures are already constructed. In practice, however, we often want to chain futures that use the results of their predecessors, like this - get_breakfast().and_then(|food| eat(food));. Try implementing this behavior by adding a new method to the SimpleFuture trait called and_then and something that models this sequential computation (like the previous AndThenFut future).\nThe real deal\nWe weren't far from the actual way Rust's futures are structured. The Future trait looks as follows:\ntrait Future {\n    type Output;\n    fn poll(\n        // Note the change from `&amp;mut self` to `Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;`:\n        self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;,\n        // and the change from `wake: fn()` to `cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;`:\n        cx: &amp;mut Context&lt;'_&gt;,\n    ) -&gt; Poll&lt;Self::Output&gt;;\n}\n\nThere are two differences here. Firstly, we use a context instead of a standalone wake method. Since this callback was just a simple function pointer, there was no way for it to hold any data pertaining to which future called it.\nSecondly, we take self as a Pin&lt;&gt;. This enables us to create immovable futures - we will go into it later.\nCoordinating futures - waker &amp; executor\nUsing wakers and context\nWe will follow the steps in the book to make a future that runs a separate thread that sleeps for a given duration and only then returns a result.\nExecutor\nWe will follow the steps in the book to create our own executor to run our futures on.\nFurther reading\n\nPinning in detail\n\n","id":"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/15-async-2/","title":"Async: Part 2"}},"docInfo":{"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/":{"body":28,"title":3},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/00-organizational/":{"body":165,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/01-introduction/":{"body":349,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/02-ownership/":{"body":1495,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/03-data-types/":{"body":227,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/04-enums/":{"body":1179,"title":1},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/05-tests/":{"body":65,"title":1},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/06-types-reasoning/":{"body":1596,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/07-feedback/":{"body":246,"title":4},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/08-closures-iterators/":{"body":67,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/09-feedback2/":{"body":261,"title":4},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/10-smart-pointers/":{"body":484,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/11-feedback3/":{"body":334,"title":4},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/12-concurrency/":{"body":420,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/13-design-patterns/":{"body":53,"title":2},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/14-async-1/":{"body":15,"title":3},"https://mimuw-jnp2-rust.github.io/lessons/15-async-2/":{"body":462,"title":3}},"length":18},"lang":"English"};
